"""Catalog-level metric-view detection.

Runs ``DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED ... AS JSON`` against a list of UC table
refs and classifies each ref as a metric view (or not) based on whether
its ``view_text`` payload parses as metric-view YAML (a ``source`` plus
``dimensions`` and/or ``measures``).

Lives in ``common`` rather than ``optimization.preflight`` so the same
helper can be invoked by every stage that needs the answer (preflight,
enrichment, follow-up refreshes) without dragging the entire preflight
module into harness's import graph.

Detection is *permissive* — false negatives only, never false positives.
A failed DESCRIBE, a non-JSON envelope, or a YAML that doesn't match the
metric-view shape records an unresolved/non-detect outcome so callers can
avoid silently treating unknown refs as table-safe.

PR 23 — Detection is also *observable*. Every per-ref outcome is recorded
in a small ``outcomes`` dict (``describe_error``, ``empty_result``,
``no_envelope``, ``no_view_text``, ``yaml_parse_error``, ``not_mv_shape``,
``detected``) so callers can emit a one-line summary even when zero MVs
are detected. Each non-detect outcome is also logged at INFO so a silent
failure cannot hide behind an empty-but-success ``MVs detected: 0``.

    """Catalog-level metric-view detection with per-ref outcomes (PR 23).

    Identical contract to :func:`detect_metric_views_via_catalog` for the
    first two return values; additionally returns ``outcomes``, a dict
    mapping every probed ``fq_lower`` to one of the ``OUTCOME_*``
    constants. Refs with empty/missing components are skipped silently
    and do *not* appear in ``outcomes``.

    Each non-detect outcome is logged at INFO with the failing
    fully-qualified ref so a silent failure cannot hide behind an
    empty-but-success result. Logs include first-120-char snippets of
    the offending payload (``view_text`` for YAML failures, the
    ``repr()`` of the exception for DESCRIBE failures) so the cause is
    actionable from the run log alone.

    PR 28 — when ``diagnostic_samples`` is supplied, the helper populates
    it in-place with one short text sample per non-detect ref
    (``describe_error`` ⇒ exception repr; ``no_envelope`` ⇒ first-cell
    snippet; ``yaml_parse_error`` ⇒ first 120 chars of view_text) so
    upstream callers can surface an actionable example in their banner
    without re-querying the catalog. The dict is keyed by the same
    ``fq_lower`` strings as ``outcomes`` and is *additive* — entries
    overwrite without consulting any prior contents so callers can
    reuse the same dict across multiple invocations.

    PR 28 — also adds a structural-signal retry: when the JSON envelope
    parses but produces no classification signal, and the ref's name
    pattern (or its envelope's ``language`` field) flags it as
    suspicious, the helper falls through to the legacy
    ``DESCRIBE EXTENDED`` path. The fallback may surface ``Type:
    METRIC_VIEW`` from a Spark connection that opted into the
    metricview metadata flag but did not return it in the JSON envelope.
    Name patterns are *only* used to gate the retry — a hit there
    without a structural signal still records ``not_mv_shape`` /
    ``no_view_text`` rather than classifying by name alone.
