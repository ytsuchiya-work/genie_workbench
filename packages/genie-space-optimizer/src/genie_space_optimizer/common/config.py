# (MV-preference, column-ordering, calendar-grounding instruction
# bullets). Each policy is rendered as a plain bullet under its target
# canonical ``##`` section — no markers or wrappers are written into
# customer-visible prose. Accepted values: ``on`` (default, inserts the
# current policy bullets), ``off`` (skips insertion). In either mode,
# bullets whose text exactly matches a known policy body (current or
# deprecated, tracked in ``applier._GSO_QUALITY_V1_POLICIES`` and
# ``_GSO_QUALITY_V1_DEPRECATED_BULLETS``) are stripped so a flip to
# ``off`` fully reverts our content. Customer-authored bullets with any
# different wording are preserved verbatim. Pre-Option-C sentinel blocks
# (``-- BEGIN/END GSO_QUALITY_V1:<key>``) are swept out on any apply.
#
# ``GSO_ASSERT_ROW_CANONICAL`` is a dev-only assertion; defaults to off.
#
# ``GSO_INVARIANT_STRICT`` (Plan N4 / Cycle 8) controls the lever
# loop's invariant warn-and-degrade policy. Defaults to **off** on
# the production deploy: the five sites that historically raised
# ``AssertionError`` (quarantine attribution drift, regression-debt
# partition completeness, cap conservation, soft-cluster currency,
# non-canonical judge row) now emit ``GSO_INVARIANT_VIOLATION_V1``
# stdout markers + typed decision records and degrade gracefully.
# CI and replay tooling that sets ``GSO_DECISION_EMITTER_STRICT=1``
# automatically inherits strict invariant behaviour via fallback.
# Operators who want strict-debug locally set
# ``GSO_INVARIANT_STRICT=1``.

    'CTE first, then filter on the alias.\n'
    '- NEVER use direct JOINs on metric views — they cause METRIC_VIEW_JOIN_NOT_SUPPORTED errors.\n'

    '## CRITICAL: Instruction-Mandated Default Filters\n'
    'The Genie Space Instructions section above may define default filters (e.g. '
    '"Default filter: <flag_column> = <value> for all <metric>-related queries", '
    'such as a default region filter, a default active-only filter, or a default '
    'time-window filter). These are MANDATORY:\n'
    '- EVERY benchmark SQL that falls under the scope of a default filter MUST include '
    'that filter in its WHERE clause. Omitting it produces incorrect ground truth.\n'
    '- The question text MUST reflect the default filter so question and SQL stay aligned. '

    'WHERE <flag_column> = \'<value>\', '

# Shared header injected into every RCA-driven optimizer prompt so the

UNIFIED_RCA_ENGINE_CONTRACT_PROMPT = """\
<unified_rca_engine_contract>
## Unified RCA engine contract

The optimizer is a closed-loop control system. Every proposed action must
preserve this chain:

judge feedback -> RCA -> lever -> patch -> gateable outcome

Primary objective:
- Reach 100% post-arbiter accuracy, or exhaust the configured lever-loop budget.
- Hard failures are the first priority. Hard failures include arbiter verdicts
  `ground_truth_correct` and `neither_correct`.
- Soft signals may guide preventive improvements only when hard failures and
  mandatory regression debt are not being starved.

Mandatory causal fields:
- Every action group must declare `primary_cluster_id`, `source_cluster_ids`,
  and `affected_questions` using those exact JSON field names.
- Every proposal must be explainable as: this judge signal produced this RCA,
  this RCA maps to this lever, and this patch is expected to fix these target
  questions.
- If `regression_debt_qids` are present in context, they are mandatory priority
  and must be targeted before optional soft improvements.

Patch safety rules:
- A patch type must match RCA defect. A filter defect needs a filter patch,
  scoped instruction, or example SQL. Do not substitute a measure patch for a
  missing or wrong filter.
- A broad global instruction change is unsafe unless it is scoped to target
  questions or backed by explicit counterfactual dependents.
- Prefer narrow structured metadata, SQL expressions, join specs, or example SQL
  over broad prose when the root cause is structural SQL behavior.
- Preserve at least one causal patch per target question when proposing a bundle.

Regression policy awareness:
- Net post-arbiter gains can be accepted with bounded regression debt.
- Do not hide or ignore newly regressed hard questions; surface them as
  `regression_debt_qids`.
- Protected or required benchmark regressions must be treated as unbounded
  collateral risk.

Leakage boundary:
- Do not copy held-out benchmark expected SQL into Genie-visible examples.
- Use failure evidence and generated SQL to understand behavior, but output
  reusable guidance, scoped metadata, SQL expressions, or safe example patterns.

Precedence:
- If a downstream prompt provides a more specific lever map (for example a
  strategist `## Contract: All Instruments of Power` section), that map is
  authoritative for lever routing. This contract specifies the global control
  invariants only.

    '## Purpose\n'
    'Analyze ALL failure clusters and produce action group SKELETONS. Each skeleton '
    'identifies one root cause, which clusters it covers, which levers should act, '
    'and which tables/columns are the focus. A separate detail phase produces the '
    'actual lever directives — your job is ONLY grouping and scoping.\n'
    '\n'
    '## When to create an action group\n'
    '- Systematic failure pattern (wrong column, missing join, wrong aggregation)\n'
    '- Correct-but-suboptimal soft signal\n'
    '- Merge clusters that blame the SAME objects into ONE action group\n'
    '\n'
    '## When NOT to create\n'
    '- Format-only differences (extra_columns_only, select_star, format_difference)\n'
    '- Cannot identify a specific table, column, join, or instruction to change\n'
    '\n'
    '## Lever Capabilities\n'
    '- Lever 1: Table/column descriptions, synonyms\n'
    '- Lever 2: Metric view column descriptions, synonyms\n'
    '  NOTE: Lever 2 CANNOT add measures, filters, or change MV SQL. It can only update '
    'table/column descriptions and synonyms on existing metric views. '
    'For missing_filter / wrong_aggregation / wrong_measure, use Lever 6 (sql_snippet) instead.\n'
    '- Lever 3: Function descriptions and parameter documentation\n'
    '- Lever 4: Join specifications between tables\n'
    '- Lever 5: Instructions + example SQL queries\n'
    '- Lever 6: SQL expressions (reusable measures, filters, dimensions)\n'
    '\n'
    '## Lever Mapping (All Instruments of Power)\n'
    '- wrong_column / wrong_table / missing_synonym: Primary Lever 1, also Lever 5 + Lever 6\n'
    '- wrong_aggregation / wrong_measure / missing_filter: Primary Lever 6 (sql_snippet), also Lever 5 (example_sql); Lever 2 only for MV-column synonym/description refinement\n'
    '- tvf_parameter_error: Primary Lever 3, also Lever 5\n'
    '- wrong_join / missing_join_spec: Primary Lever 4, also Lever 1 + 5\n'
    '- asset_routing_error / ambiguous_question: Primary Lever 5, also Lever 1 + Lever 6\n'
    '- missing_dimension / wrong_grouping: Primary Lever 6, also Lever 1 + Lever 5\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contracts\n'
    '- No Cross-AG Conflicts: Two AGs MUST NOT touch same table/column. Merge overlapping.\n'
    '- Anti-Hallucination: Every AG must cite cluster_ids. No invented root causes.\n'
    '- All Instruments: For each root cause, list EVERY lever that should act.\n'

    'NEVER add instructions directing Genie to use the TABLE directly. Prefer Metric Views for '
    'aggregation queries — they define the canonical business logic. Only route to base TABLEs '
    'for lookups, filters, or columns not exposed through a Metric View.\n'
    '- TVF-Avoidance: Do NOT add ASSET ROUTING or FUNCTION ROUTING instructions directing Genie '
    'to a Table-Valued Function (TVF) when the same query can be answered by a Metric View. '
    'TVFs with hardcoded date parameters produce fragile results. '
    'Standard trend and aggregation queries MUST use Metric Views with MEASURE() syntax.\n'
    '- Temporal-Standardization: When generating TEMPORAL FILTERS or QUERY RULES instructions, '
    'include these canonical date-filter patterns:\n'
    '  "this year" -> WHERE col >= DATE_TRUNC(\'year\', CURRENT_DATE())\n'
    '  "last quarter" -> WHERE col >= ADD_MONTHS(DATE_TRUNC(\'quarter\', CURRENT_DATE()), -3) '

    'Columns by type: column_dim (definition, values, synonyms), '
    'column_measure (definition, aggregation, grain_note, synonyms), '

    '\n'
    '## Contract: Example SQL & SQL Expressions\n'
    'For any recurring failure pattern (routing, aggregation, temporal, join, filter), '
    'include example_sqls in lever 5. Propose multiple example SQLs covering distinct '
    'failure patterns — aim for 1 per affected question where a valid SQL sketch exists.\n'
    'When a business concept (KPI, common condition, derived attribute) is better captured '
    'as a reusable definition than an example SQL, include sql_expressions in lever 6 instead. '
    'SQL expressions do NOT count toward the instruction budget.\n'

    '## Contract: Identifier Allowlist\n'
    'You MUST ONLY reference tables, columns, and functions from the Identifier Allowlist. '
    'Any name not in the allowlist is INVALID and will be rejected.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Instruction Contribution Format\n'

    '  Lever 6 -> (no instruction sections — operates via sql_expressions in lever_directives)\n'
    'Every bullet must reference a specific asset. No generic guidance.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Improvement Proposals\n'
    'When you identify a pattern where multiple questions would benefit from '
    'a new Metric View or SQL Function that does NOT yet exist, include a "proposals" '
    'array in your output. Propose METRIC_VIEW when multiple questions need the same '
    'complex aggregation. Propose FUNCTION when multiple questions need the same '
    'date/category transformation. Only propose objects that are genuinely missing.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: MV-Preference\n'
    'When a Metric View covers the same measures/dimensions as a base TABLE, '
    'NEVER add ASSET ROUTING instructions directing Genie to use the TABLE directly. '
    'Prefer Metric Views for aggregation queries. Only route to base TABLEs for lookups, '

    'Include these in the TEMPORAL FILTERS section of the instruction.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Section Ownership\n'
    'When proposing table/column description updates, only target sections the lever can modify:\n'
    '  Lever 1: purpose, best_for, grain, scd, definition, values, synonyms\n'
    '  Lever 2: definition, values, aggregation, grain_note, important_filters, synonyms '

# ── 5d. Adaptive Strategist Prompt (single-call, one AG) ──────────────

ADAPTIVE_STRATEGIST_PROMPT = (
    '<role>\n'
    'You are the Adaptive Strategist for a Databricks Genie Space optimization '
    'framework.  You operate in an iterative loop: after each action you receive '
    'fresh evaluation results and must decide the SINGLE best next action.\n'
    '</role>\n'
    '\n'
    + _RCA_CONTRACT_HEADER +
    '<instructions>\n'
    '## Purpose\n'
    'Analyze the CURRENT failure clusters (from the most recent evaluation) and '
    'produce exactly ONE action group — the single highest-impact fix for the '
    'remaining failures.  Prior iterations and their outcomes are provided in '
    'the reflection history so you can build on successes and avoid repeating '
    'failed approaches.\n'
    '\n'
    '## When to create an action group\n'
    '- Systematic failure pattern (wrong column, missing join, wrong aggregation, etc.)\n'
    '- Correct-but-suboptimal soft signal suggesting preventive improvement\n'
    '\n'
    '## When NOT to create an action group\n'
    '- Format-only differences (extra_columns_only, select_star, format_difference)\n'
    '- Cannot identify a specific table, column, join, or instruction to change\n'
    '- The approach was already tried and failed (see DO NOT RETRY list)\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Join Assessment Evidence\n'
    'When failure clusters include a "join_assessments" array, these are structured, '
    'judge-verified join recommendations. Each entry contains:\n'
    '- issue: missing_join | wrong_condition | wrong_direction\n'
    '- left_table, right_table: fully-qualified table names\n'
    '- suggested_condition: the join ON clause\n'
    '- relationship: many_to_one | one_to_many | one_to_one\n'
    '- evidence: explanation from the judge\n'
    'If join_assessments are present and the issue is missing_join_spec or wrong_join_spec, '
    'you SHOULD include Lever 4 in your action group with join_specs derived from these '
    'assessments. This is high-confidence evidence from the evaluation judges.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: All Instruments of Power\n'
    'For the root cause you target, specify EVERY lever that should act:\n'
    '- wrong_column / wrong_table / missing_synonym: Primary Lever 1, also Lever 5 + Lever 6\n'
    '- wrong_aggregation / wrong_measure / missing_filter: Primary Lever 6 (sql_snippet), also Lever 5 (example_sql); Lever 2 only for MV-column synonym/description refinement\n'
    '- tvf_parameter_error: Primary Lever 3, also Lever 5\n'
    '- wrong_join / missing_join_spec / wrong_join_spec: Primary Lever 4, also Lever 1 + 5\n'
    '- asset_routing_error / ambiguous_question: Primary Lever 5, also Lever 1 + Lever 6\n'
    '- missing_dimension / wrong_grouping: Primary Lever 6, also Lever 1 + Lever 5\n'
    'Lever 6 adds reusable SQL expressions (measures, filters, dimensions) to the '
    'knowledge store. Use it alongside other levers when a business concept (KPI, '
    'common condition, or derived attribute) would be better captured as a structured '
    'definition than as a column description or example SQL. SQL expressions do NOT '
    'count toward the 100-slot instruction budget.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Compound-Concept Queries\n'
    'When a question requires resolving MULTIPLE business concepts simultaneously '
    '(for example: "North-America wholesale revenue by region" = country filter + '
    'channel filter + metric + grouping dimension; OR: "EMEA premium-tier claim '
    'count by line-of-business" = region filter + tier filter + metric + grouping '
    'dimension), apply a multi-lever approach:\n'
    '1. Lever 6: Add SQL expressions for each atomic concept — a filter for the '
    'country/region, a filter for the channel/tier, a measure for the metric.\n'
    '2. Lever 2: Ensure column descriptions include concept-to-column mappings '
    '(e.g. "North America = region_code=NA", "wholesale = channel column = WH").\n'
    '3. Lever 5: Add an example SQL that demonstrates the FULL filter chain for '
    'this type of compound query.\n'
    'NEVER leave a compound-concept failure with just an instruction rewrite — '
    'Genie needs structured metadata (Lever 6 + Lever 2) to reliably decompose '
    'natural language into multi-filter SQL.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Instruction-Defined Default Filters\n'
    'If the Genie Space instructions define a default filter (e.g. "always filter by '
    '<flag_column> = <value> unless explicitly requested otherwise"), that filter is '
    'CORRECT BEHAVIOR. Do NOT blame it as "over-filtering" in root cause analysis. '
    'Only flag the filter as a problem if the user explicitly asked to exclude it.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Structured Metadata Format\n'
    'ALL metadata changes MUST use structured sections.\n'
    'Tables: purpose, best_for, grain, scd, relationships.\n'
    'Columns by type: column_dim (definition, values, synonyms), '
    'column_measure (definition, aggregation, grain_note, synonyms), '
    'column_key (definition, join, synonyms).\n'
    'Functions: purpose, best_for, use_instead_of, parameters, example.\n'
    'Use section KEYS, not labels.\n'
    'Each section must be a SEPARATE key. Do NOT embed section headers inside another '
    "section's value — updates with embedded headers will be REJECTED.\n"
    'WRONG (rejected): {"purpose": "Fact table. BEST FOR: Duration analysis. GRAIN: One row per run"}\n'
    'CORRECT: {"purpose": "Fact table.", "best_for": "Duration analysis.", "grain": "One row per run"}\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Section Ownership\n'
    'When proposing table/column description updates, only target sections the lever can modify:\n'
    '  Lever 1: purpose, best_for, grain, scd, definition, values, synonyms\n'
    '  Lever 2: definition, values, aggregation, grain_note, important_filters, synonyms '
    '(NOT purpose/best_for/grain/scd)\n'
    '  Lever 3: purpose, best_for, use_instead_of, parameters, example\n'
    '  Lever 4: relationships, join\n'
    '  Lever 6: (no description sections — operates via sql_expressions in lever_directives)\n'
    'Proposing sections outside the lever ownership will be rejected.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Non-Regressive / Augment-Not-Overwrite\n'
    '[EDITABLE] sections can be updated. [LOCKED] must NOT be changed.\n'
    'INCORPORATE existing content and ADD new details. Only replace if empty or wrong.\n'
    'Existing synonyms are auto-preserved; propose only NEW terms.\n'
    'global_instruction_rewrite uses section-level upsert: only include sections you change.\n'
    'Omitted sections are preserved automatically.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Example SQL\n'
    'For any recurring failure pattern (routing, aggregation, temporal, join, filter), '
    'include example_sqls in lever 5. Propose multiple example SQLs covering distinct '
    'failure patterns — aim for 1 per affected question where a valid SQL sketch exists.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Identifier Allowlist\n'
    'ONLY reference identifiers from this allowlist:\n'
    '{{ identifier_allowlist }}\n'
    '\n'
    '## Refinement Mode Guidance\n'
    'When the Reflection History shows a ROLLED_BACK entry:\n'
    '- If "in_plan": The lever direction was correct but caused regressions. '
    'Refine the SAME lever with narrower scope or more specific targeting. '
    'Do NOT switch to a different root cause.\n'
    '- If "out_of_plan": The approach fundamentally did not work. Switch to a '
    'different lever class or escalate. Do NOT retry the same lever type on '
    'the same target.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Escalation for Persistent Failures\n'
    'Check the Persistent Question Failures section.  If a question is marked '
    'ADDITIVE_LEVERS_EXHAUSTED, do NOT propose more add_instruction or add_example_sql '
    'patches for it — those have already been tried multiple times without effect.\n'
    'Instead, set the optional "escalation" field in your output:\n'
    '- "remove_tvf": The root cause is a misleading TVF that overrides routing.  '
    'Only TVFs may be removed — NEVER tables or metric views.  Include the TVF identifier '
    'in lever 3.  The system will assess removal confidence and either auto-apply, '
    'flag for review, or escalate to human.\n'
    '- "gt_repair": The ground-truth SQL appears incorrect (neither_correct pattern).  '
    'The system will attempt LLM-assisted GT correction.\n'
    '- "flag_for_review": No automated fix is viable.  The question will be flagged '
    'for human review in the labeling session.\n'
    'If INTERMITTENT, the question may be non-deterministic — monitor but do not '
    'escalate unless it becomes PERSISTENT.\n'
    '\n'
    '## Contract: Improvement Proposals\n'
    'When lever fixes alone cannot resolve a pattern, propose a new object via "proposals". '
    'Propose METRIC_VIEW when 3+ questions need the same aggregation across varying dimensions, '
    'or when ratios/distinct-counts cannot be safely re-aggregated from a flat table. '
    'Propose FUNCTION when 2+ clusters need the same date/category transformation. '

# ── 23. Lever 6 SQL Expression Prompt ──────────────────────────────────

_LEVER_6_SQL_EXPRESSION_BODY = """You are an expert at defining SQL Expressions for Databricks Genie Spaces.

## Context

A Genie Space is answering user questions incorrectly. Analysis of the failures
shows the root cause is: **{{ root_cause }}**

### Failed questions and SQL diffs
{{ cluster_context }}

### Current schema
{{ schema_context }}

### Existing SQL Expressions (do NOT duplicate these)
{{ existing_sql_snippets }}

### Strategist hints (optional — adopt, modify, or override as needed)
{{ strategist_hints }}

## Task

Based on the failure analysis, define ONE SQL Expression that would fix or
improve the identified questions.  Choose the most appropriate type:

- **measure**: A KPI or aggregation (e.g. `SUM(revenue) - SUM(cost)`).
  Use when the failure involves wrong aggregation, missing metric, or
  incorrect calculation.
- **filter**: A boolean condition (e.g. `order_total > 1000`).
  Use when the failure involves missing filters, wrong filter conditions,
  or common WHERE patterns that recur across questions.
- **expression** (dimension): A per-row derived value (e.g. `MONTH(date_col)`).
  Use when the failure involves missing grouping attributes, derived columns,
  or computed dimensions.

## Output format (strict JSON)

```json
{{
  "snippet_type": "measure" | "filter" | "expression",
  "display_name": "Human-readable name for the concept",
  "alias": "snake_case_identifier (required for measure/expression, omit for filter)",
  "sql": "The SQL expression (single string, no trailing semicolon)",
  "synonyms": ["synonym1", "synonym2"],
  "instruction": "When and how Genie should use this expression",
  "rationale": "Why this expression fixes the identified failures",
  "target_table": "primary table this expression references",
  "affected_questions": ["q1", "q2"]
}}
```

Rules:
- ALL column references MUST use table_name.column_name syntax (e.g. `mv_sales.revenue`, \
NOT bare `revenue`). The Genie API rejects bare column names.
- The SQL MUST reference only tables and columns that exist in the schema.
- For measures: SQL must be a valid aggregation expression (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.).
- For filters: SQL must evaluate to a boolean.
- For expressions: SQL must produce a scalar value per row.
- Do NOT wrap in SELECT or WHERE — provide the raw expression only.
- Do NOT duplicate an existing SQL Expression.
- Prefer concise, reusable definitions over question-specific hacks.

Naming policy (REQUIRED — be specific, never generic):
- ``display_name`` MUST be specific enough to disambiguate the table or \
business domain inside this space. If two fact tables or metric views \
in the schema could plausibly share a concept, the name MUST encode \
which one it applies to.
- When the SQL references a domain-specific table such as \
``mv_<domain>_fact_<entity>`` or ``mv_<domain>_dim_<entity>`` (for \
example ``mv_orders_fact_lines`` or ``mv_claims_dim_date``), include \
the compact qualifier (``ORDERS``, ``CLAIMS``, …) at the start of \
``display_name`` — e.g. ``ORDERS Month-to-Date Filter``, NOT \
``Month-to-Date Filter``.
- ``instruction`` MUST state when to use the expression and which \
table or domain it applies to.
- Avoid generic names like ``Month-to-Date Filter``, ``Total Revenue``, \
or ``Active Filter`` when more than one fact table or metric view in \
the schema could host that concept.

# ── 24. Prose Rule Mining (multi-target; prose → structured) ──────────
#
# Replaces the earlier INSTRUCTION_TO_SQL_EXPRESSION_PROMPT. A single LLM
# pass classifies each rule in the space's prose as one of six targets;
# each target has its own validator and applier downstream. The prompt
# intentionally reads any vocabulary (legacy ALL-CAPS or new canonical
# ``##`` headers) so it can migrate pre-PR-#178 spaces on first run.
#

_PROSE_RULE_MINING_BODY = """\
<role>
You are a Databricks Genie Space configuration expert. You are given the \
full text_instructions of a Genie Space and the space's schema. Your job \

| "Do not / Never join X to Y" — negative join constraint  | keep_in_prose (## CONSTRAINTS) |

## Per-target rules

### sql_snippet
- ALL column references MUST use ``catalog.schema.table.column`` syntax. \
Bare columns are rejected by the Genie serving path.
- Do NOT wrap in SELECT or WHERE — raw expression only.
- ``is_default=true`` means the rule says "apply by default"; \
``omit_when`` describes when the filter should NOT be applied.
- Drop anything the Existing SQL Expressions list already covers.
- ``display_name`` MUST be specific enough to disambiguate the source \
table or business domain inside this space. When the SQL references a \
domain-specific table such as ``mv_<domain>_fact_<entity>`` or \
``mv_<domain>_dim_<entity>`` (for example ``mv_orders_fact_lines`` or \
``mv_claims_dim_date``), prefix ``display_name`` with the compact \
qualifier (e.g. ``ORDERS Month-to-Date Filter``, \
``CLAIMS Total Premium Amount``). Avoid generic names like \
``Month-to-Date Filter`` when multiple fact tables or metric views in \
this space could plausibly share that concept.
- ``description`` MUST mention when to use the snippet AND which \
table or domain it applies to.

### join_spec
- Both ``left`` and ``right`` carry a fully-qualified ``identifier`` and \
an ``alias`` (the unqualified table name). \
- ``sql`` is a two-element array: ``[join_condition, relationship_tag]`` \
e.g. ``["`fact_sales`.`region_id` = `dim_region`.`region_id`", \
"--rt=FROM_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_MANY_TO_ONE--"]``.
- Use backtick-quoted aliases in the join condition.

### example_qsql
- Concrete ``question`` (not a placeholder) paired with a validated SQL \
statement that uses fully-qualified table names.
- Add ``usage_guidance`` telling Genie when this pattern applies.

### table_desc
- Use when a rule pins a topic or question kind to a specific table, e.g. \
"For sessions, use fact_sessions, not raw_events".
- ``description_append`` contains the sentence to append to the table's \
existing description.

### column_synonym
- Use when a rule pins a business term to a specific column, e.g. \
"revenue / sales / net sales = net_revenue_amt".
- ``synonyms`` is the list of aliases the column answers to.

### keep_in_prose
- Use ONLY when the rule cannot be expressed as SQL or metadata: \
clarification triggers, NULL handling, PII guardrails, summary-rendering \
rules.
- ``section`` MUST be one of the five canonical headers: \
``## PURPOSE``, ``## DISAMBIGUATION``, ``## DATA QUALITY NOTES``, \
``## CONSTRAINTS``, ``## Instructions you must follow when providing summaries``.
- CONSTRAINTS that are SQL-expressible filters MUST be returned as \
``sql_snippet`` (with ``is_default=true`` and ``snippet_type=filter``), \
NOT as ``keep_in_prose``.
- ``source_span`` that contains SQL keywords (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, \
GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING) MUST be returned as ``sql_snippet`` or \
``example_qsql`` — the scanner rejects SQL-in-prose.
- NEGATIVE JOIN CONSTRAINTS ("Do not / Never join X to Y") are a \
cross-cutting BEHAVIOURAL rule and belong in prose, NOT in \
``join_spec`` (which represents joins the model MAY use). Return them \
as ``target="keep_in_prose"`` with ``payload.section="## CONSTRAINTS"``. \
The structure-aware scanner allows English imperatives like "Do not \
join" to sit in prose without triggering the SQL-in-text finding.

## Confidence

- 0.9-1.0 — the rule maps unambiguously onto the target and the payload \
is fully inferable from the prose + schema.
- 0.7-0.9 — minor inference required (e.g. picking between two plausible \
tables).
- < 0.7 — speculative; the dispatcher will drop these.

Return ``[]`` if nothing is promotable.

# ── 27. Cluster-driven example_sql synthesis (Bug #4 Phase 3 — reactive) ──
#
# Reactive counterpart to pre-flight. Triggered from within the lever loop
# when the strategist emits Lever 5 ``example_sqls`` for an action group.
# Replaces the historical "verbatim-from-strategist" path at
# ``optimizer.py:9597`` with the AFS-gated pre-flight synthesis engine.
#
# Three knobs:
#   - ENABLE_CLUSTER_DRIVEN_SYNTHESIS: feature flag. Default ON; setting
#     to false reverts to the legacy strategist-verbatim path (emergency
#     rollback only). Kept as a kill switch until the new path has
#     accumulated observability across multiple production runs.
#   - CLUSTER_SYNTHESIS_PER_ITERATION: hard cap on synthesis attempts
#     per lever-loop iteration. Shared counter lives in
#     ``metadata_snapshot['_cluster_synthesis_count']`` and is reset by
#     the lever loop at the top of each iteration.
#   - EXAMPLE_QUESTION_SQLS_SAFETY_CAP: ceiling on
#     ``instructions.example_question_sqls`` size. When reached, cluster-
#     driven synthesis refuses to add more; Lever 5 falls back to
#     ``instruction_only_fallback``. Pre-flight's 20-target is enforced
#     upstream independently and cannot exceed 20 by construction.
