"""Stage 3: Cluster Formation (Phase F3).

Wraps the existing ``optimizer.cluster_failures`` primitive with a
typed ``ClusteringInput`` / ``ClusterFindings`` surface so F4 (action
groups) can read clusters from a stage-aligned dataclass instead of
harness locals. Also splits promoted vs rejected clusters by
``demoted_reason`` so Phase D.5 alternatives capture has a typed
surface.

F3 wires the harness's hard + soft ``cluster_failures`` pair into a
single typed call (Phase F+H Commit A1). ``form(ctx, inp)`` calls
``optimizer.cluster_failures`` internally for both branches with
identical args except ``spark`` (form passes ``spark=None``; replay-
fixture mode is unaffected because spark is None everywhere there,
but production runs skip the spark-conditional ``read_asi_from_uc``
UC enrichment at ``optimizer.py:1913-1915``). The harness inline
``cluster_failures(...)`` calls (formerly at ``harness.py:9158``
hard, ``9171`` soft) are deleted by A1. The ``cluster_records`` /
``rca_formed_records`` emissions at ``harness.py:12318+`` /
``:12349+`` continue to read the harness's ``clusters`` /
``soft_clusters`` locals which the A1 adapter populates from
``_cluster_findings.clusters`` / ``_cluster_findings.soft_clusters``.

The promoted-vs-rejected split assumes ``cluster_failures`` may stamp
``demoted_reason`` on its returns; today (verified at A1 audit time)
it does not, so ``rejected_cluster_alternatives`` is always empty —
``_split_by_demoted`` is a forward-compatible no-op.
