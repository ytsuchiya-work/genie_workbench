"""Proposal grounding: drop patches whose targets do not appear in any
failing question's surface, then keep small auditable bundles.

The retail run shipped 8-patch bundles whose targets did not match the
failures the strategist claimed to be addressing. AG2 in particular
patched ``zone_combination`` / ``market_combination`` column
descriptions even though the failing benchmarks (Q011's missing
``YEAR(date_key_2)`` GROUP BY, Q009's wrong customer-count measure)
had nothing to do with those columns. This module enforces a
deterministic relevance check before apply:

* Every patch declares its targets via standard fields (``column``,
  ``target``, ``metric``, ``join_target``, ``instruction_section``,
  ``table``, ``section_name``, ``snippet_name``).
* Every failing eval row exposes its surface — column names from
  generated/expected SQL plus tokenized NL response.
* A patch's relevance is the fraction of its targets that overlap
  the union of failing-row surfaces.

Crucially, the comparison is purely local — schema identifiers and
tokenized NL only. No benchmark text is sent to an LLM or a remote
service, so the leakage firewall (Bug #4) stays intact.
