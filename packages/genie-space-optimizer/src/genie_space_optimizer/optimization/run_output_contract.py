"""Stable GSO Run Output Contract vocabulary.

Reads as the canonical vocabulary; never imports MLflow, Spark, or
Databricks SDK. All callers (transcript renderer, bundle assembler,
evidence_bundle, mlflow_audit, gso-postmortem skill) share these
constants and path builders.

Reconciliation with the G-lite stage registry (stages/_registry.py):

  - STAGES (9 entries) is the executable iteration target.
  - PROCESS_STAGE_ORDER (11 entries) is the human-readable transcript
    ordering.
  - The reconciliation rule is locked by
    tests/unit/test_process_stage_order_matches_stages_registry.py:
    every STAGES.stage_key must appear as a PROCESS_STAGE_ORDER.key.
