"""Single-criterion lever-loop acceptance.

Background
----------
The previous acceptance gate ran two full evaluations per iteration,
estimated run-to-run variance, widened the regression tolerance,
switched between pre-arbiter / post-arbiter / blended objectives, and
applied a K-of-N strict check. The retail run still accepted a
``-4.6pp`` post-arbiter regression on AG2 because pre-arbiter
improvement (under ``OPTIMIZATION_OBJECTIVE='pre_arbiter'``) masked the
post-arbiter loss.

After re-deriving the model with the user, we replaced all of that with
a single criterion: **post-arbiter accuracy must improve by at least
``min_gain_pp`` percentage points over the carried baseline**. Variance
is no longer estimated. There is no second confirmation eval. There is
no objective switch — the arbiter's adjudication is the headline metric
end-to-end.

Safety net (Option D)
---------------------
The gain floor itself acts as a guardrail: setting
``MIN_POST_ARBITER_GAIN_PP=2.0`` means any iteration that lands within
``±2pp`` of the baseline is rejected, removing the noise band entirely.
Cross-iteration drift (a "lucky" accept whose true position regresses
later) is caught by a separate post-hoc diagnostic in
``harness.py`` — it logs a ``suspected_stale_baseline`` decision-audit
row but never auto-rolls back. Operator review.

The function is pure over its inputs so unit tests can replay AG1/AG2
metrics without a Databricks cluster.
