Scorer assembly — 9 judges for Genie Space evaluation.

Scorers that depend on runtime context (``spark``, ``WorkspaceClient``)
expose ``_make_*`` factory functions.  Use ``make_all_scorers()`` to get
a fully bound ``all_scorers`` list ready for ``mlflow.genai.evaluate()``.

Stateless scorers (``asset_routing_scorer``, ``result_correctness_scorer``)
are importable directly.
